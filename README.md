Creating and Training a Basic Autoencoder on the MNIST Dataset
This "project" is a simple notebook that demonstrates the creation and training of a basic autoencoder using the MNIST dataset. Key steps include:

Data Loading and Preparation: Loading MNIST data for training.
Autoencoder Design and Training: Building a straightforward autoencoder model with PyTorch, training it on the MNIST dataset, and evaluating its reconstruction performance.
Latent Space Exploration: Visualizing the learned latent space.
Interpolation and Generation: Generating new images by interpolating across the latent space to explore how the autoencoder represents different digits.
